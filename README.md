# Overview

As a software engineer passionate about leveraging geospatial data to solve real-world problems, I developed a map software application aimed at enhancing the dining experience in Rexburg, Idaho. This software provides a user-friendly interface for exploring various restaurants in the area, presenting users with information such as cuisine type at the click of a marker. 

The application was built using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, enabling dynamic interaction with geospatial data. Users can easily navigate the map, zoom in and out, and click on restaurant markers to reveal detailed information about each establishment. This project utilizes publicly available data, including restaurant locations and details, to populate the map markers.

The purpose behind creating this software was to familiarize myself with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology and to explore its applications in everyday decision-making processes, such as choosing a place to eat.

# Development Environment

The development of this map software involved a range of tools and technologies that facilitated a smooth and efficient development process. The core of the application was developed using:

- **Visual Studio Code** as the integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and managing the codebase.
- **ArcGIS API for JavaScript** provided by Esri, which served as the primary library for rendering the map and its features.
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for structuring and styling the application's user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** as the programming language to implement interactive functionalities and to integrate the ArcGIS API within the application.

# Useful Websites

Throughout the development of this project, several resources were invaluable in providing guidance, documentation, and troubleshooting assistance:

* [ArcGIS for Developers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/) - Official documentation and tutorials for the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.
* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Comprehensive documentation for web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - Community forums for troubleshooting and expert advice on programming-related queries.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Tutorials and references for web development languages.

# Future Work

There are several enhancements and features I plan to integrate into the map software in the future to improve its functionality and user experience:

* **User Reviews and Ratings Display** - Incorporate a feature to display customer reviews and ratings for each restaurant directly within the popup information.
* **Advanced Filtering Options** - Implement filtering capabilities that allow users to display restaurants based on cuisine type, rating, or other criteria.
* **Real-time Data Integration** - Explore options for integrating real-time data, such as current wait times or live occupancy levels.
